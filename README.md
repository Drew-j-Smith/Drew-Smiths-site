# Drew smith's website

This is my _was_ my first real html project. I want to use this website as a professional way to present myself.

The original version was created with plain HTML and [Material Design Lite](http://getmdl.io/).
The second version was created with [Gastbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
The current version was created with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

## Building the website

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec middleman
```
